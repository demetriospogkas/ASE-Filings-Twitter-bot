# ASE-Filings-Twitter-bot

The Python code I wrote for mining company announcements from the Athens Stock Exchange webpage and automating tweet postings whenever a new one has been issued.

See the bot in action here: http://bit.ly/DemASEFilings.

You may reproduce the code and the logics behind it for developing your own projects.
